  	<p>
Assuming is stifling <br>
Worrying solves nothing <br>
Helping other people helps me <br>
Everybody thinks they are right <br>
Money does not make me happy <br>
Trying to look good limits my life <br>
Having guts always works out for me <br>
Low expectations are a good strategy <br>
Everybody who is honest is interesting <br>
Complaining is silly. Either act or forget <br>
Everything I do always comes back to me <br>
Being not truthful always works against me <br>
Keeping a diary supports personal development <br>
Material luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses <br>
Travelling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life <br>
Drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later on <br>
Actually doing the things I set out to do increases my satisfaction <br>
<br>

Thinking that life will be better in the future is stupid. I have to live now. </strong> </h1> <br>
