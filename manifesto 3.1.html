  <p>
Helping other people helps me.
Having guts always works out for me.
Thinking that life will be better in the future is stupid. I have to live now.
Being not truthful always works against me.
Everything I do always comes back to me.
Assuming is stifling.
Drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later on.
Money does not make me happy.
Travelling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life.
Keeping a diary supports personal development.
Trying to look good   limits my life.
Material luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses.
Worrying solves nothing.
Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.
Actually doing the things I set out to do increases my satisfaction.
Everybody thinks they are right.
Low expectations are a good strategy.
Everybody who is honest is interesting.
